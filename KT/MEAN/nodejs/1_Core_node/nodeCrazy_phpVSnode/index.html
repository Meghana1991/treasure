 This is the response from the server when you try to hit the server.
 PHP is server side. Hence when you ask web server like apache to serve you this index.html file, then you get this msg.
 Assume I have a server ABC installed in Germany. You opened a website of ABC and clicked on Hello button using HTTP protocol. The call goes to Apache. The apache which is web server serves the requested page. In this case index.html will be picked up by apache and then give to PHP to parse it and (query the backend if needed or open/write/modify files on germany server) and then to compile it to machine code, then the machine code runs in runtime environment. The ready code is now sent as response in the HTTP protocol channel back to me!
