prod:build -> 
minifies files -> 
goes into build folder of our project->
and the entire folder contents gets copied to nginx folder
from there, nginx triggers index html file which has path for all the minified files
so nginx will serve the files.

When we login first time -> it picks up from the folder inside nginx

Whenever we make any changes to the code, we build it -> it gets converted to .war file which inturn has many minified .js files with one index.html.

----------------------------------------------

User logs in > minified files are picked by the nginx server which are present in the nginx folder,the minified files came to nginx when the build happens(build:prod or jenkins build) > Whenever code is changed and build, then the fresh code changes displays.
